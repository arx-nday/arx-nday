Hi, Iâ€™m @arx-nday  
Iâ€™m interested in developing cool features and making users life better  

What i'm usually use:  
- PHP (latest released ver.)
- WordPress(common? sure, but prefer [bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/)), WooCommerce
- Laravel
- JavaScript (prefer ES8+ over jquery), jQuery
- React
- Git, Docker, Linux, nginx
- Design patterns 
  
Familiar with:
- OpenCart
- Old PHP (since 5.4)
- Old JavaScript
- Old Laravel (work with it since ver. 5.4)  
  
I'm not a fan of old legacy tons of random code but can analyse it and update all your outdated things.
